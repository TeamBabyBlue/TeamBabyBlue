            <p id="textClass">Life at X-uni is often difficult as danger and short deadlines are constant companions to its students. A stoic
            view of life is required as well as solid determination.
          Once a student is enrolled at X-Uni he undergoes a variety of training exercises that will help him to control his powers.</p>

        <p id="HistoryText">After the N-gene was identified in the 1940's there have been constant conflicts between humans
        and programmers. At the beginning the new sub-species was ignored even made fun of until it took control. One day ordinary humans
            realised that their whole lives were controlled by these people carrying the new mutant gene.
        Today people possessing the N-gene (named after Professor N) are considered extremely gifted and misunderstood.
        Thus Professor N decided to devote his life to safeguarding innocent programmers
            from human oppression, believing that both could peacefully coexist.
        <br> He decided to establish his Institute for the Gifted and found students with extraordinary talents such as
            super human coding skills and problem solving. Some of these (like the Bankin Wolverine or Bogi the Cyclops) would later decide to stay and become teachers of the next
            generation of N-men.
            <br>
            More mutants moved into and out of the institute as the N-Men family grew.
            Unfortunately the original building is now destroyed in the great battle of 2014.
            While it was being rebuilt, the N-Men briefly relocated to an island in the
            Bermuda Triangle. When the institute was rebuild, it was upgraded with future technology and enhanced WI-FI capabilities.
            Nakov's School operates as a private academy in
            Sofia, but is secretly a training ground for mutants.

            Students are subjected to variety of training exercises that would allow them to enhance their skills
            and develop their powers. Classes include:<br>

           <br/><strong>Time Travel Java Homework</strong><br><br>
            <img src="train1.jpg" alt="training Java" class="T1"><br><br>
            Students with the power to send a person's consciousness into the past team up
            with other students. The teams are given homework two weeks ago and they have to
            go back and finish it before the present moment.
            <br>

            <br/><strong>Telepathic Debugging</strong><br><br>
            <img src="train2.jpg" alt="training Telepathy" class="T2"> <br><br>
            Students with extreme telepathic ability must help
            their team mates debug a broken code without actually touching
            their keyboards.
            <br>
            <br/><strong>Super-Sonic Coding</strong><br><br>
            <img src="train3.jpg" alt="training Speed" class="T3"> <br><br>
            Students possessing super speed are taught to
            write a program while braking the speed of sound. <br>
            <br/><strong>Teamwork and Personal Skills</strong><br><br>
            <img src="train4.jpg" alt="training Teamwork" class="T4"> <br><br>
            In order for the students to improve their teamwork they are given the following exercise:
            Teams of four are locked in a training room with giant sentinel robots, programmed to kill them
            on sight. The squads must work together in order to survive. The ones who don't make it usually
            do not graduate X-Uni.
