    			<header id="Question1">Son programmer</header>
		    	<div id="Theme">I'm 38, and a single dad to my 13 year old son, 14 in four months. The other day I asked my son if I could borrow his iPad and he gave it to me. After my first 	attempt at Google searching something I noticed that he forgot to delete his history as a lot of the search terms were along the lines of "Am I a programmer ? What now?" 
					I love him regardless if he is a programmer or not. I have always felt that he is not like the other children. Now I think I know why. I want to tell him that I know his secret and it is really not a problem. It is time for programmers to be accepted as a integral part of our society! I am thinking of enrolling him at the Nakov Institute for the gifted. How will they help my boy?

    			<header id="Question2">Java Time Travel Homework</header>
	    		<div id="Theme">Hello! I am having troubles regarding the Java Time Travel Homework assignment.  I was wondering if I go back to my past self and do my homework wouldn’t this cause some time paradoxes? Will I remember the future once I have  gone back. Also the Novikov self-consistency principle states that  time corrects itself and a traveler can not really change the future. Ergo, what if I try to do my homework but I am prevented by this principle. Would I still receive points for the assignment?</div>

	    		<div id="Theme">Good day fellow programmers! I have a question regarding our enemies. First of all who are they? Are they known to us? Are they organized under some faction that is bent on destroying us? Also what is our position in our relationship with the human race? Are they to be considered friendly to our cause? Or are they a threat? Are we ? Maybe we should start a PR campaign to improve our image to the general populace. It wouldn’t hurt. </div>

	    		<div id="Theme">A question has been bugging me ever since I started at X-Uni. I consider myself above average in my field but a voice in my head just keeps repeating the following: “Am I really a developer or just a good googler?” I solve most problems that come at me but when things get tough (and that is more often that I like to admit) I open google search for solutions. Does this make me a bad programmer? How did people cope without having to google things ? </div>

	    		<div id="Theme">I am posting from the position of a concerned citizen! How are we to know what is happening behind the doors of Nakov’s new institute?! They have been reports of strange people around the area of the X-Uni building. Who are these people? Do they pose a threat to our peaceful society? Is Nakov building an army? Who can guarantee our safety if these… these.. things decide to rise against us?
