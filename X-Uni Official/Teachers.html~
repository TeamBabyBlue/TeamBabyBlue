                    Svetlin Nakov (also known as Professor N) has 20+ years experience of technical background as discoverer of people with superhuman powers.
                    He founded X-Uni to teach mutants to coding and control their powers.
                    Its first group of students are Ache Magneto, The Bankin Wolverine, Bogy The Cyclops and Rossy Storm.
                    X-Uni's students consider him a visionary and often refer to their mission as "Nakov's dream".

                    Magneto is powerful mutant with the ability to generate and control magnetic fields.
                    Magneto desired mutants with power coding skills to eventually dominate the human race
                    as he viewed humans as an outdated species that no longer deserves its continual domination over the world.
                    <span class="bold">He can turn invisible by warping visible light around his body and thus can always catch you as copying during the exam.</span>
                    In addition to his powers, Magneto has many other skills. He is a genius with competence in various fields of advanced science,
                    especially in genetic manipulation and particle physics.

                    Wolverine is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology.
                    His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, typically referred to as his mutant healing factor,
                    that regenerates damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human.
                    Wolverine's healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to <span class="bold">liters of whiskey, vodka and rakia.</span>
                    However, he can still suffer the immediate effects of such substances in massive quantities.
                    He has been shown to become intoxicated after significant amounts of alcohol <span class="bold">"100 liters of vodka"</span> and has been incapacitated on several occasions with large amounts of <span class="bold">homemade apricot rakia.</span>

                    Bogy the Cyclops is one of the first true N-men. His also considered as one of the most powerful and trusted among them.
                    He discovered his coding powers when he was very young and has been using them ever since.
                    He can also shoot a powerful laser beam from his eyes but he rarely does,
                    since an accident in high school when <span class="bold">he incinerated one of his teachers.</span>
                    Professor N soon discovered him and took him under his wing.
                    Bogy was fitted with special glasses that help him control the laser and
                    also write high-quality code. Today he teaches classes to his fellow mutant
                    programmers and helps them every way he can. His dedication and honesty are
                    qualities that the gifted students value highly.

                    Rosy the Storm is one of the few women at X-Uni.
                    Researchers are still baffled by the lack of female programmers.
                    Some theories state that men are more prone to developing the N-gene,
                    while others think that gifted women are just unwilling to reveal themselves.
                    Statistically the number of male and female N-gene carriers should be about
                    the same. Nevertheless, Rossy is one of the braver former attendants and
                    current assistant at X-uni. She has the ability to invoke the elements of
                    nature when writing a code.  Her power grows every day. S
                    he helps a lot of the new students with their problems which include
                    doing homework assignments and improving themselves.
