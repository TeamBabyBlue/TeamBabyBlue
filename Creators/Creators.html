                        We are <span id="babyblueteam">BABY BLUE TEAM</span>, a stundents crew in Software University. This web site
                        was created by us during the Web Fundamentals course. We were inspired by X-men story. Mr.Nakov and his                                   extraordinary teachers crew taught us how to create impressive and well-looking web sites. We have also improved
                        our teamwork skills, and uniting our superpowers created this well-looking project. Everyone of us has his own
                        stack of superpowers, that's why our project is completely impressive.

                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
                        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
                        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                        He discovered his powers only recently but in truth he has always felt different among normal people. He knew he didnâ€™t fit and his hopes are that he has finally found a true place of acceptances among his X-Uni peers. Powers include: lightning-fast speed and ability to predict the near future and change it.
